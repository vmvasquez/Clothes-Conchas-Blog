        <p>From the moment I drove over the state line from New Hampshire into Maine I was counting down until I could get a Lobster roll. I've had them back home but this was going to be the <em>real</em> deal. Spolier Alert, I was not disappointed. The restaurant I found myself at offered a tio of Lobster Roll Sliders and they were amazing. Picture left to right: butter, lime crema and dill. The buns were toasted perfectly and were the ideal size. The lobster itself was so fresh, tender and probably would have been fine on its own. Out of all of the flavors I would have to choose the butter. It was so simple but so perfect. </p>

        <p>I would like to think this is the East coast version of In-N-Out. Overall, a pretty solid burger, fries and local brew. Shout out to our server for recommending the "Starvin Student". </p>

        <p>Milk Bar's cereal milk soft serve. Taste's just like milk and the corn flakes (They put some on the bottom before they put the ice cream in. Then more on top. Much appreciatedðŸ‘Œ) make for the perfect combo of salty and sweet. My friends and I loved it so much we went twice. Located in The Cosmopolitan Milk gives a great atmosphere. I believe <em>Eater Las Vegas</em> says it best in the quote below:</p>
    </div>
    <blockquote cite="https://vegas.eater.com/2017/1/10/14194302/milk-bar-las-vegas-eater-inside">
        <p>"The storefront here is very much a milk truck brought back to life, taking cues from the visual design of the NoLita and Chelsea stores, incorporating a kitchen and storefront all in one. Guests can watch the cakes being baked and peak inside the kitchen."</p>
